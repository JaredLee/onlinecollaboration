      <!-- Explanation -->
      <div class="article1">
        <p>Collaboration is a type of communication that has been done by humans throughout history. In the simplest of its form, collaboration exists when two or more parties work together, whether it be because of having the same goal or due to having common interests. <br><br>When it comes to the internet and communicating online, collaboration between people has never been easier. Instead of meeting up together and talking face-to-face, people can just hop onto a collaboration tool online, whether it be Skype, Discord, Microsoft Teams, or others. This allows people to communicate from the comfort of their homes instead of going through the hassle of getting to a location. <br><br>Now, online collaboration has its limitations too. By meeting people through the screen, they are unable to communicate via touch and gestures. Sure, they can open up their camera, but they wouldn’t be able to point at something at another person’s screen. There are many workarounds over these issues, including screen sharing and even allowing others to control your computer, but then there are further complications to these solutions. </p>

        <h1>So the main question is this:</h1>
        <h2> What is the most effective way of collaboration through the Internet?</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="article1">
        <p> The effectiveness of collaboration has a lot of variables that depend on the collaboration itself. Group dynamics, number of people, the tools used, time limits, and more. There is no “BEST” way to collaborate, but there is for sure more efficient methods to do so. Compared to individually doing the task at hand, collaborating with others would always seem to be better, as two heads are better than one. With two people or more, there would be more ideas, more viewpoints, and things would generally move faster, but some would argue that having more people would be detrimental to a team effort if they are moving against the clock. With more people, there would be more suggestions, more arguments, and more time allocated to discussions rather than actually doing the task itself. </p>

        <p>Thus, effectiveness is a very qualitative concept and in order to measure it, it needs to be translated into something qualitative. </p>

      <div class="article1">
        <p>In order to get the quantitative data required to measure effectiveness, we need to set up an activity that people can collaborate on and implement variables or limiting factors into that activity. </p>
      <!-- Experiment explanation (animation on experiment, Simple Scroll Animation) -->
        <h1 class="experimenthead">The experiment goes like this:</h1>
        <p>We will be playing a game called the "Wikipedia Race" or "Wiki Game" <br><br> 1) The players will be given 2 random words <br><br> 2) The players then start by going to the wiki page of the first word, then through clicking the hyperlinks in that wiki article, the player have to reach the other word. <br><br>3) At the end of the game, the time and number of hyperlinks that the player have clicked would be recorded. This data would be the quantitative data</p>

        <!-- Go to Results -->
        <p>Using these findings, we can thus determine how effective the collaboration is by setting up a scoring system using the product of both time and number of clicks. The lower the score, the more effective the collaboration is. Click the button below to see the results </p>
